# 👋 Hi, I'm Priya — Data Scientist & GenAI Practitioner

I design and build intelligent systems end-to-end — from raw data to production-ready models.  
With strong experience in ** Deep Learning, NLP, PyTorch**, and **scalable ML pipelines**, I enjoy solving real-world problems using clean architecture, experimentation discipline, and a practical delivery mindset.

Currently diving deeper into **GenAI, RAG systems, and Agentic AI** to push what AI can do next.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working On
- Production-grade **GenAI pipelines** (RAG, LLM apps, agent workflows)
- Advanced experimentation in **Agentic AI** for workflow automation
- Improving LLM **evaluation, optimization, and deployment** strategies

---

## 🧠 What I Bring
- Hands-on expertise in **Deep Learning, NLP, and PyTorch,Tensorflow/Keras**
- Expertise in designing **end-to-end ML/DL systems** (ETL → modeling → deployment → monitoring)
- Strong background in **model deployment** (FastAPI, Dockerized services, cloud workflows, MLFlow,PyDantic)
- Solid ML/DL/NLP knowledge + an engineering mindset for scalable solutions
- Ability to simplify complexity and communicate clearly with any audience
- And yes… a habit of debugging code that no one else claims responsibility for 😄

## 🔍 Research Interests & Collaboration

I’m deeply interested in **Research Scientist–level work**, especially in:

- **Designing and improving Transformer-based architectures**  
- **Building efficient attention mechanisms** (sparse, linear, long-context)  
- **LLM fine-tuning, optimization & evaluation**  
- **RAG systems & Agentic AI design**  
- **End-to-end GenAI systems** (from modeling → deployment)  
- **Applied NLP research**, especially scalable representation learning  
- **Reproducibility projects** based on recent research papers

👯 **I’m excited to collaborate on:**  
- Novel ideas around **Transformer architecture improvements**  
- Reproducing and extending **state-of-the-art research papers**  
- Experimental pipelines in **PyTorch** with clean ablations  
- GenAI/LLM apps with real-world impact  
- Any project where curiosity + experimentation = insight
