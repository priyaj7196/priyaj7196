# 👋 Hi, I'm Priya — Data Scientist & GenAI Practitioner

I design and build intelligent systems end-to-end — from raw data to production-ready models.  
With strong experience in **Deep Learning, NLP, PyTorch**, and **scalable ML pipelines**, I enjoy solving real-world problems using clean architecture, experimentation discipline, and a practical delivery mindset.

Currently diving deeper into **GenAI, RAG systems, and Agentic AI** to push what AI can do next.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Working On
- Production-grade **GenAI pipelines** (RAG, LLM apps, agent workflows)
- Advanced experimentation in **Agentic AI** for workflow automation
- Improving LLM **evaluation, optimization, and deployment** strategies

---

## 🧠 What I Bring
- Hands-on expertise in **Deep Learning, NLP, and PyTorch**
- Experience designing **end-to-end ML systems** (ETL → modeling → deployment → monitoring)
- Strong background in **model deployment** (APIs, Dockerized services, cloud workflows)
- Solid ML foundations + an engineering mindset for scalable solutions
- Ability to simplify complexity and communicate clearly with any audience
- And yes… a habit of debugging code that no one else claims responsibility for 😄

---

## 🤝 Collaboration Interests
- GenAI / LLM-based applications  
- Intelligent automation & agentic workflows  
- Full-stack ML projects with real business impact  
- Anything involving DL, NLP, or PyTorch at scale
